[This year](https://github.com/pankdm/icfpc-2017/blob/master/task/task-v1.3.pdf) ICFPC
was essentially about writing AI to modified version of "Ticket to Ride".


The results are not available yet, and there were no live scoreboard, so we have
to wait until final results are announced to get the idea how we did this year.
In short though, I think, we didn't do well: we developed some cool algorithms, but
due to bugs that we haven't fully fixed during contest,
they were performing worse than greedy baseline solution, so we had to send that.


# **My Thoughts**
 * By spirit this year was resembling 2012 (the one with AI to Supaplex-like game).
Organizers also promised to change task description and similarly there was no
live scoreboard. These are the details that I didn't like about this contest.
 * Because of changing constraints and addition of new features it felt a lot like
 Software Engineering contest. One would need to write flexible solution that would
 allow quick iterations and easy modifications in the anticipation of changes.
 * Task itself was fairly simple and easy to understand: no specification of VM or other obfuscations.
 I think of this as a downside. For 3 days marathon I was expecting something more
 challenging.
 * It would be interesting to see what other teams developed and was there
 anything beyond optimized search with heuristics.

# **Lessons learned**
 * **Develop testing infrastructure earlier**. We implemented arena that allowed verification
 of algorithms on scale only 36 hours into the contest. Before that we were
 relying on ad-hoc testing that has large variance.
 * **Implement algorithms incrementally**. We got 2 fairly sophisticated algorithms,
 but we tested them on scale only during final round which revealed that on large maps
 they loose to greedy solution.
 * **Don't postpone end-to-end integration**. We underestimated complexity involved and
 were not trying to run offline mode until 6 hours before the end.

# **Our Algorithms**

### ChaosPunter
Very primitive solver that keeps track of not-taken edges and chooses one of them
at random.

### GreedyPunter
This is fairly straightforward greedy approach. At each move let's consider all available
edges and take the one the maximizes the score:

1. Copy the players graph
2. Add the new edge to the graph
3. Run BFS from each mine using player's graph to get which cities are connected
4. Accumulate the score using precomputed distances from original graph


### FastGreedyPunter

The same idea as `GreedyPunter` but uses better data structures to avoid doing `M`
BFS-s (`M` is number of mines) which was quite slow on large maps.
More specifically, we implemented class `ComponentsList` to maintain connected
components for particular player with the following API:

 * `void union(c1, c2)` - unite 2 connected canonical components `c1` and `c2`
 * `int component(v)` - return the canonical component for vertex `v`
 * `list<int> nodes(c)` - return all nodes for component `c`
 * `void start_transaction()` -  start of transaction with all subsequent
`union`-s
 * `void rollback_transaction()` - cancel all union-s that were done since the
 start of latest transaction


 Internally `ComponentsList` uses the following data structures:

  1. `list<int>` of size n to keep track of canonical components for all vertexes.
  2. `list<set<int>>` of size n for nodes that belong to particular component

On `union(c1, c2)` we move each node `v` from `c2` to `c1` and add `(v, c2)` to
transactions stack that would allow to do a reverse operation.
If we make simple optimization to always move from smallest component then
both `union` and `rollback_transaction` has complexity `O(min(c1, c2))`.


### FastGreedyStochasticBridgesVerticesMaxPunter

This is a modification of `FastGreedyPunter` using as objective function
weighted combination of 4 features:

 * `score_gain` - actual increase in our score
 * `bridge_gain` - find bridges in the graph and incentivize claiming those  
 * `vertex_gain` - for each `u` compute sum of `-d(u,v)` over all `v` in graph
 and use this as a score. The motivation is to claim vertices that are "central"
 to graph.
 * `stochastic_gain` - do random moves and using score from achieved positions

Then we defined "initial" phase of the game by condition
`current_move < 3.0 * math.sqrt(num_vertices)`. In "initial" phase
enabled `bridges_gain` and `vertex_gain` and disabled `stochastic_gain`.


### MTCSSolver

`MTCS` stands for "Monte Carlo Tree Search", but our author was mostly referring
to it as `VladSolver`. The idea is fairly simple: let's simulate a number of games
and then take a move that has highest probability of winning.

Due to huge problem space this approach doesn't work as is, so we implemented a number
of heuristics to narrow down number of possibilities.

TODO: explain heuristics

# **Infrastructure**

### tcp client

In the first iteration we made a simple wrapper that would communicate with
game server over TCP-IP and call corresponding API of classes implementing `PunterIf`:

```python
class PunterIf:
    def get_handshake(self): pass
    def process_setup(self, data): pass
    def process_move(self, data): pass
```

Using sockets was quite easy in python. Here is sample code:

```python
import socket
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(SERVER, PORT)
data = s.recv(BUFFER_SIZE)
```

The only tricky part was that `recv` might return not the whole data, so we
had to first read the stream until `":"` accumulating result into buffer. And
then keep reading until getting expected size of the message.

### visualizer

We reused js part of graph UI from organizers and implemented our own server in NodeJS.
We also added option to replay logs that helped with debugging AI behavior.

### local server

We implemented server in python that would connect 2 or more players and
manage game between them. Players have well defined python API so there
was no need to communicate via tcp-ip for them and this simplified integration a lot.


### arena

To test algorithms on scale we implemented arena (`q3arena.py`) on top of local server.
It would continuously run matches with registered bots and record results.

We had a file `q3maps.py` with pre-defined maps:

```python
def m(map_name, **kwargs):
    return ("maps/{}".format(map_name), kwargs)

MAPS = [
    m("sample.json", n=2),

    m("lambda.json", n=4),
    m("circle.json", n=4),
    m("Sierpinski-triangle.json", n=3),

    m("tube.json", n=8),
    m("randomMedium.json", n=8),
    m("randomSparse.json", n=8),
    m("boston-sparse.json", n=8),

    m("edinburgh-sparse.json", n=16),
    m("gothenburg-sparse.json", n=16),
    m("nara-sparse.json", n=16),
    m("oxford-center-sparse.json", n=16),
    m("oxford2-sparse-2.json", n=16),
    m("van-city-sparse.json", n=16),
]
```

and `q3robots.py` with registered algorithms:

```python
from all_solvers import *

def create_all_robots():
    return [
        create_punter(ChaosPunter, name="ChaosSolver"),
        create_punter(FastGreedyPunter, name="FastGreedyPunter"),
        create_punter(FastGreedyStochasticPunter, name="FastGreedyStochasticPunter"),
        create_punter(FastGreedyStochasticBridgesMaxPunter, name="FastGreedyStochasticBridgesMaxPunter"),
        create_punter(VladSolver2, name="Vlad-MCTS-2j"),
        create_punter(VladSolver3, name="Vlad-MG-3b", timeout=0.8),
        create_punter(VladSolver4, name="Vlad-MG-4b", timeout=0.8),
        create_punter(FastGreedyStochasticBridgesVerticesMaxPunter, name="FastGreedyStochasticBridgesVerticesMaxPunter"),
        create_punter(FastGreedyBridgesVerticesMaxPunter, name="FastGreedyBridgesVerticesMaxPunter"),
        create_punter(FastGreedyStochasticVerticesMaxPunter, name="FastGreedyStochasticVerticesMaxPunter"),
    ]
```

Arena was storing logs in 2 places:

 * `arena/results` has raw results with metadata and could be aggregated or analyzed later
 * `arena/battle_logs` has actual moves in the same format as visualizer for
 step-by-step analysis of matches.


To get faster results from arena we used server with 32 cores and ran it in parallel
using the following hacky bash commands.

Start arena:

```
for i in {1..30}; do python q3arena.py & done
```

Stop arena:

```
ps aux |grep q3arena |awk '{print $2}' |xargs kill -9
```

### offline mode

In our solution, in order to be runnable offline, solver itself needs to implement 2 methods:

 * `get_state()` that would return a tuple of internal state
 * `set_state(state)` that would restore from the tuple provided

then we glued this all together using `cPickle` and `base64` module:

```python
# return state
state = self.get_state()
pickled_state = cPickle.dumps(state)
encoded_state = base64.b64encode(pickled_state)
output_json["state"] = encoded_state

# restore from state
encoded_state = input_json["state"]
pickled_state = base64.b64decode(encoded_state)
state = cPickle.loads(pickled_state)
self.set_state(state)
```
