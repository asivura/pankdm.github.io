CLARKS HOLE [CLAH]:  There are a number of swimming holes along the North Fork of the American River outside of Auburn in the Auburn State Recreation Area . Clark's Hole is one of the best. YOUTUBE . A short but steep trail down to the hole with rugged cliffs around. This is just above where the Middle Fork American joins the North Fork American - it is generally not recommended that you swim in the Middle Fork, which is a challenging whitewater rafting river. The Recreation Area stretches for miles along both forks.   To get here: and take RT 49 south. Keep on Rt 49 through Auburn. In about 3 miles RT 49 will cross the American River. Park near here and follow the trail upstream on the North Fork. In about .5 miles of hiking you will pass under a highway bridge (Forrestville Rd) and in about another .25 miles you will come to Clark's Hole, big and deep.

UNIVERSITY FALLS [UNIV]:   Beautiful series of low falls, waterslides and swimming holes. PHOTO , YOUTUBE , YOUTUBE . . (The following directions are by Tim Joyce.)   Arrive early (before 10 a.m.) or late (after 3 p.m.) to avoid the boom box-and-cooler crowd. Best time to visit is July and during the summer. Early in the season the falls are too strong. This swimming hole is dog friendly.  As with all swimming holes, swim at your own risk; there are no lifeguards at University Falls and there have been accidents. University Falls is 30 miles (50 minutes) east of  Auburn. To get here from Auburn, continue on RT 49 south to the town of Cool. Go east on RT 193 to Georgetown. Go left onto Main St. (you will know you are in Georgetown because all the trucks and motorcycles park in the middle of  main street. Traffic passes on both sides); this is Wentworth Springs Rd. There is a grocery store in town here. Also, there are no other gas stations on route, so plan on gassing up in Georgetown. Take this road (Wentworth Springs Road) out of town for about 12 miles. Note: The El Dorado Ranger Station will be about half way on this road on your right. It is a good place to stop for a free map. They also have well maintained restrooms. This is the closest legal restrooms to the falls. Better stop for junior there.

Just after passing into the town of Quintette, find parking on the left (you will know you have crossed into Quintette because there is a road marker on the right as you enter the town). The parking is on the left side of the road near the gate. A large yellow gate has been constructed to prevent vehicles from accessing the service road you will be hiking on. The yellow gate we are talking about it the gate right before the University of Berkeley Headquarters (Blodgett Experimental Forest Headquarters) entrance way. If you go by the Blodgett Forest Headquarters entrance way, you have gone too far. Google maps shows the yellow gate and limited parking area if you are interested in looking at it prior to your hike. Please don't block the gate or access to the service road or you will get towed!!

Note: this is not an easy swimming hole to find. One wrong turn and you will end up in the woods hiking for a long time. Please bring enough back-up water and food for your hike. However, the hike is fairly easy and
not that steep (except the final 1/4 mile descent). Junior should be able to handle it if you follow these directions.

From the yellow gate, allow 90 minutes to walk in. Walk past the bright yellow gate; 200 feet past the gate, continue straight on the fire road (Note that the trail forks at about 200 feet past the gate. Stay straight or on the right at this first fork. The left turn at the fork descends down into an old logging area. You will know you have gone the wrong way if the road is not clear. The correct hiking road is wide and clear and should not require anything more than sneakers).

Hike for about 0.5 miles until you reach a second fork. You will know you have reached this fork because right in the center of the fork is a Forest sign  road marker (12N67B). The markings on the sign have been scratched by vandals. However, it is still legible. Go left at this fork and hike about 1 mile down until you reach a large clearing. (Note: Prior to reaching this clearing you will pass one or two dead-end distracter trails on the right and then some newly planted trees (Blodgett Experimental Forest)). There are some logs and rocks marked with blue arrows at the clearing. At the clearing the trail continues straight or turns sharply to the right and heads down hill. Follow the arrows and trail to the right and down hill. Follow the trail down hill for 0.25 miles. The trail then turns sharply left and then continues down until the road. At the road you need to take a sharp hair pin turn to the right. You will be walking along the Pilot Creek water canal, flume etc.. which will always be on your right. You will pass a pile of gravel also. The trail then bends left.

You need to follow this road with the flume on your right for about 0.5 miles (the flume or water canal will always be on your right). Just as you have almost given up hope, there is an obvious sign on your left. There is also a tree marked with blue wording that says "Falls". Follow this trail left and down about 100 feet until the next clearing.  At the clearing you will be tempted to go straight. Don't do it! There is a tree with a  park sign on it that is a distracter. It is like a Siren calling you in the wrong direction away from your goal. Follow the trail to the right. There are some blue arrow markers guiding you in the correct direction (right). It's a little brushy. The trail descends fairly steeply for about 0.25 miles. The first steep descent will require you to "hike a bike" if you biked in and didn't walk. It is too steep to ride down - not recommended. Walking is fine. The trail then flattens and proceeds down again steeply. You will pass an overturned red pick up truck on your left. At this point you should hear the falls. There is a second blue pick up truck on your right as you proceed further down to the bottom of the trail. The swimming area starts right near the second truck. To reach the top of the falls keep walking down the trial. It takes you to the top of the falls. The 3 main water slides are just below. The water slides are each 30 to 80 feet wide and about 12 to 15 feet deep.  LAT, LON lat=38.9293, lon=-121.0385 (source: measured by another) (accuracy: approximate) LINK TO GOOGLE MAP. Very confident. Verified by another. Updated 4/2010.

Please be careful at the lower Falls!!  A number of people have been killed around the 4th water slide. It is difficult to reach and the drop beyond this slide is treacherous. A rope has been constructed to help for getting out of the pool. Don't trust it. People have missed the rope and have been washed over the falls. Please be careful!!

Hikers, Please read this link!!! http://www.wikiloc.com/wikiloc/view.do?id=121383

WATER   Bass Lake
TYPE    Lake
DESCRIPTION Hike 2.6 miles (each way) to escape the crowds in Point Reyes National Seashore and join the bathing-suit-optional, laid back folks at Bass Lake. No real beach here and sometimes a bit muddy but good swimming, a great ambiance and a rope swing to play on. Even when it is foggy on the road, it is often clear at the lake. See web sites for more info:NATIONAL SEASHORE , NUDE BEACHES OF MARIN COUNTY. 
AREA    Point Reyes National Seashore
SANCTION    Unofficial
FEE None
FACILITIES  Unknown
ACTIVITIES  Swimming, Rope Swing
PHONE   (415) 663-1092 (National Seashore)
CAMPING Walk-in, primitive camping (only) at the National Seashore
BATHING SUITS   Optional (very!)
DIRECTIONS  From San Francisco, take RT 101 across the Golden Gate then RT 1 north. Just past Bolinas Lagoon, turn left at the exit to Bolinas (may be unsigned). Follow the road along the lagoon until it ends then take Olema-Bolinas Road to the stop sign at Mesa Road. Go right on Mesa Rd. and go about 4 miles where it turns to dirt and ends at a parking area. There is a sign at the trailhead by the lot which will direct to Palomarin Trail. The hike to the lake is about 2.3 to 2.6 miles one way. Although the ocean breeze makes this hike fairly cool in the summer you should still bring water.

Your hike will take you past a grove of eucalyptus trees. After you pass the eucalyptus trees you will pass by a cliff on your left that gives you a beautiful view of the Pacific ocean. You then will proceed up a hill for about 1 mile. You then come to a trail intersection that reads "Coast Trail" , Wildcat camp 3.3 miles or Palomarin trail 2.2 miles. Stay on the Palomarin trail. Follow this trail until you reach another trail marker that says "Bass Lake". You turn left at this sign and follow the trail down to the lake. You will know you are on the right trail since you will get a view of the lake on your left. 

The actual trail to the waters edge is not easy to locate. It is about 0.6 miles down on the left just past the end of the lake. It is not easy to spot on your left since there is much poison ivy. You know you have missed it if the trail starts to slightly ascend and the canopy begins the thicken. If you take this trail it will take you to a clearing close to the lake where most people camp and sun bathe. The rope swing is another 0.2 miles past this small camp. In the attached photos you can see the tree with the rope swing (it is the large tree on the water at about 1 PM in both photos). On a hot day I have seen up to 30-40 people here. Most of the time you will have the place to yourself. When you come to a grass meadow walk to the lake - there are 3 paths.

DESCRIPTION At the heart of the wild and remote Big Sur is the deservedly-popular Pfeiffer-Big Sur State Park, through which courses the Big Sur River just before it empties into the Pacific. Of course, you can swim in the Pacific nearby (at Andrew Molera State Beach) but there are also several fresh water swimming holes in the Big Sur River in Pfeiffer-Big Sur S.P.. South of here, along the coast, is Eslen hot springs and other swimming holes. For details see DIRECTIONS below.

DIRECTIONS  From Monterey, go south on RT 1, then:

CAMPGROUND [CAMP]:Follow signs to Pfeiffer - Big Sur State Park on RT 1.  Enter the Pfeiffer- Big Sur State Park. The charge to get into the park is $10.00 (June, 2010).  In the Big Sur river where it passes by the campground is a deep hole with a large rock forming a pleasant and accessible swimming hole enjoyed by many campers.

NOTE: People often confuse Preiffer-Big Sur State Park with Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park. Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park is named after Julia Pfeiffer Burns, a well respected pioneer woman in the Big Sur country. The park stretches from the Big Sur coastline into nearby 3,000-foot ridges. It features redwood, tan oak, madrone, chaparral, and an 80-foot waterfall that drops from granite cliffs into the ocean from the Overlook Trail. A panoramic view of the ocean and miles of rugged coastline is available from the higher elevations along the trails east of Highway 1. As you are traveling south from Carmel you will encounter Pfeiffer -Big Sur State Park first. Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park is further south on Highway 1.    walden's pond
A Family-Friendly 
Walden's Pond
GORGE [GORG]:   Also in the Pfeiffer - Big Sur State Park: For a spectacular swimming hole setting, go to the far eastern end of the road along the river in the park then hike upstream along the Big Sur river for about 10 minutes, some scrambling over rocks and wading in water is required, to get to the gorge. Here a deep pocket of cold water is surrounded by massive smooth rocks. PHOTO 1 , PHOTO 2 . A report from a visitor:"The large swimming area quickly became overcrowded while we were there. However, the downstream area offers a fine area for Jacuzzi soaking, splashing and swimming in a smaller, more intimate setting. I was amazed to see that virtually everyone was overlooking the river portion as they walked to the main pool upstream". LAT, LON lat=36.24815, lon=-121.76988(source: measured) (accuracy: exact) LINK TO GOOGLE MAP. Bathing suits for sure. For good swimmers only, it can be difficult to find a place to scramble out on the boulders. Very confident. Verified. Updated 12/15/2005.

To get here,  enter the Pfeiffer- Big Sur State Park. The charge to get into the park is $10.00 (June, 2010).   Proceed to the Lodge which will be on your right. The Lodge has a restaurant and bathrooms. There is also a general store here.  At the fork near the Lodge, bear left (it actually is the middle road) and follow this road along until you reach parking area #3 or #4. You will know you are on the correct road because the river will be on your right side. The correct parking for The Gorge is at the end of the road. At parking area #3 there is a paved path with a sign indicating that The Gorge is 0.6 miles. Follow the paved path up the hill until you reach the river. There is a plank bridge to cross the river. After crossing the river follow the road to the left through the camping area until you reach a clearly marked trail. Follow the trail up the river for about 0.2 miles. Note that the best approach is to stay to the right. The path will take you almost all the way to The Gorge. You will reach a point you can not go any further and will have to drop straight down into the river (there is a log you must climb over). Most people remove their shoes here. At this point you will need to cross the river to the other side. It is shallow enough to wade across. The water is not too deep here. The trail continues on the left side until you reach the rock impound at the base of The Gorge. If you follow these directions you will only need to cross the river once and will not need to boulder hop. If you cross too early on the left side you may have to boulder hop or cross back in a deep section of the river.

Note: There is no jumping at The Gorge. Also, recently there have been significant deposits of sand on the bottom of The Gorge area making it much more shallow than in 2009. The only deep section
now is on the side of The Gorge near the rock impound. It is about 8 feet deep. However, the good news is there is more beach area for chairs.

ESALEN HOT SPRINGS [ESAL]: While you are in the neighborhood, go further down RT 1 for a late night visit to the beautiful hot springs at Esalen Institute. Natural hot water is led into stone pools above the thundering Pacific. (The old pools were destroyed in mud slides in 1998, but are now rebuilt - as of 9/04.) Photos of new pool and facility: PHOTO , PHOTO . Unless you are staying at Esalen, you can only use the pools from 1AM to 3AM (yes, AM!), for which you pay $20.00 a person and for which you MUST make reservations ahead, either in person or by calling 831-667-3047. (There is also a new "personal retreat" program for "Friends of Esalen" whereby you can register to spend one or more days partaking of programs, including the hot springs, without being in a particular workshop. See the web site for details.) Bathing suits are not necessary. Outstanding experience, worth losing a little sleep over, don't miss it! LAT, LON lat=36.126250, lon=-121.641742(source: Topozone ) (accuracy: approximate) LINK TO GOOGLE MAP. (Lots of mind-expanding workshops at Esalen too; see their web site at www.esalen.org ). To get here from Pfeiffer; continue down Rt 1 to signs for Esalen Institute. Very confident. Verified. Updated 12/15/2005. 

SALMON CREEK FALLS [SALF]: Awesome waterfall near the south end of Big Sur area (Los Padres N.F.) with great swimming hole in pool at the bottom. PHOTO , PHOTO,  PHOTO . Bathing suits may be optional. LAT, LON : lat=35.81601, lon=-121.35673(source: measured) (accuracy:exact) LINK TO GOOGLE MAP . To get here, go way south on RT 1, 7.5 miles south of Gorda. There is a tight turn in the road with a large parking spot on the east side of the road. You can see the waterfall from the road. Park and look near the south side of the bridge for the Salmon Creek trailhead (you may have to hunt a bit for this but it is marked). Follow the trail for about 5 minutes until it comes to a clear area like a campsite and follow one of the small trails down to the creek. You will tell you are on the right trail because it does not require "bush-whacking" to get to the falls. (Alternately, simply follow the sound of the water, and you will arrive at the base of the falls.) 

You may be tempted to take a few trails that aren't marked that appear closest to the creek (North side of the river & bridge. Most people will be parking and walking down toward the trail head).
One trail has a steep section and requires you to maneuver around a tree root near a dangerous  trench and then cross a log bridge under a tree canopy. The other heads up the Canyon wall to the left. The log bridge route will get you to the river and the falls. The other will take you to Never Never Land (don't go this way). It is much easier to just return safely back to the road and head further down (south) to the marked trail head. There is a lot of poison oak in the area heading up to the falls, so be careful!

Follow the trail for about 5 minutes until it comes to a clear area like a campsite and follow one of the small trails down to the creek. Alternatively, the trail can also travel up to a small cave area with campsite. There is an access way down that requires you to enter the cave and slide down a rock and then exit the cave. Be careful. It is good fun. This will take you to nearly the rock buttress at the base of the falls (described below). 

To get to the base of the large falls will require you to either get wet by navigating through the river or to climb over a very large rock buttress. Climbing over the rock involves a few awkward maneuvers, but can be done, even by children. Salmon Creek Falls is about 120 feet high and is not easy to photograph (because it is so high and the canyon is so narrow to access the basin). The best spot to photograph the falls is probably on the top of the rock buttress. The water from the falls is split into two or more downward flowing streams by a large rock balanced at the top of the falls. This is a falls that evokes the response "Wow".

For a beautiful picture of the falls and video please see http://swimmingholesofcalifornia.blogspot.com or http://waterfallpage.blogspot.com.

Salmon falls is one of three top rated falls in Big Sur. The other two falls that are nearby include McWay Falls and Limekiln falls. Salmon is the only falls with a swimming hole. For more info and maps see Water Falls West . Very confident. Verified by another. Updated  6/2010.

DIRECTIONS  Both Buckeye and Travertine Hot Springs are south of Reno and Carson City NV. on RT 395 near Bridgeport in CA. To get there:

TRAVERTINE [TRAV]: Travertine is a hot spring only, but a very interesting one with a great view of the Sierra-Nevada mountains (if you can overlook the dusty quarry yards nearby.) The hot springs are in travertine pools, rock hard and white as snow. PHOTO . To get there: Take RT 395 south from Carson City to Bridgeport (CA). Continue about .3 miles south of Bridgeport then go east (left) on Jack Sawyer Rd. (paved). Where the road turns right, continue straight onto an unpaved road. Pass the quarry site, up a hill to the hot springs site. There are both lower and upper pools. LAT, LON lat=38.24569, lon=-119.20494(source: Topozone ) (accuracy: exact) LINK TO GOOGLE MAP. 

BUCKEYE [BUCE]: Buckeye is a great hot spring alongside Buckeye Creek where you can cool off (not deep enough to swim) and camp within walking distance. To me, this place has it all! To get there: Take RT 395 south from Carson City to Bridgeport (CA). Just before you get into Bridgeport on RT 395, turn west (right) on Twin Lakes Rd. about 7 miles to FR 017. Turn north (right) onto FR 017 for 3 miles until after you cross the creek for the second time and you meet FR 038. If you go left here, you get to Buckeye Campground. For the hot springs, continue straight up to the top of the hill where there is a flat parking area. Park here. The hot springs are down the trail toward the creek, some on the hillside and some right down by the creek.

DESCRIPTION NOTE: As of 7/4/2011,the Forest Service has closed this trail due to complaints of property owners and a fatal accident wherein a man fell from the trail into to water. No estimate of when it will open again.

Hot, dry and steep 2.5 mile each way hike to a fantastically beautiful 90 foot waterfall with pool at the foot and rocks all around. Also known as DEVIL"S PUNCHBOWL". CAUTION: PEOPLE HAVE DIED JUMPING HERE. DO NOT JUMP! The hike out is steep uphill, better be in good hiking shape and take lots of drinking water. Apparently a lot of folks in CA are in shape as this place is heavily visited and often has a lot of trash. Take an empty bag with you and bring out more trash than you bring in, please. This place dries up in mid-summer, so go well before that.

BIDWELL PARK[BIDW]: There is a long, linear park along the Big Chico Creek, beginning in the town of Chico and going to the northeast. Lower Bidwell Park is right in Chico and is accessed from downtown via Vallambrosa Avenue and there are several swimming holes here in the Big Chico River. Some of these are called "The Bank" (near Manzanita Avenue, has a rope sometimes), and "One Mile" (One Mile may have lifeguards) and "The Wall". To get to Upper Bidwell Park, take Wildwood Rd. north out of town and follow signs to the park. Here, the swimming holes, going from south to north along the Big Chico, are called "Bear Hole", Salmon Hole and Browns Hole . Brown's hole seems to be the best - somewhat remote and with fewer crowds. CAUTION ON SALMON HOLE AND BEAR HOLE In June, 2007, a man tried to jump into Salmon Hole from a cliff at the south end of the hole and was fatally injured when he hit the bank instead. Do not jump from this cliff. Both these places sometimes have fast moving water and it is possible to be swept away and/or underneath rocks. Do not swim in fast moving currents.

DIRECTIONS  From Furnace Creek in Death Valley N. P., take RT 190 north then west to the junction with Panamint Valley Road (at Panamint Springs), then:

DARWIN FALLS [DARW]: Very special oasis in the desert - said to have water all year. About a 1 mile (each way) canyon hike leads to a series of waterfalls, one of which has a deep pool at the bottom for swimming.    To get here, continue on RT 190 west past the Panamint Valley Rd. to Panamint Springs.  Continue on RT 190 then, 1 mile west of Panamint Springs, turn south (left) on an unsigned road (dirt but is usually passable by automobiles) and follow it about 2.5 miles.  Just before you get to the "4 wheel drive" sign, take a turnoff to the right to small parking area (at 36.3277,-117.5147).  Park and hike on the well-used trail about 1 mile to the falls(do not hike up the "4 wheel drive" road, keep down by the creek, hiking directions .  There are several stream crossing involved and you go through a couple of fences.  The pool that is deep enough to swim may not be at the first falls you come to but continue to the other falls.

GREAT FALLS [GREA]: Picnic area and water play place at foot of Great Falls in the Great Falls Basin area in the Searles Valley west of Death Valley N. P.. Probably only has water in the Spring. Loose sand means four wheel drive will likely be required. To get here, take Panamint Valley Rd. south from RT 190.  BEFORE you get to Trona (north of Trona), just before the golf course on the east side (left - has a small sign), there is a sandy road on the west side (right) leading up to the Great Falls Basin area. If you miss the little golf course sign - easy to do - and come to the high school in Trona, then turn around and it is 4.7 miles north (back the way you came) of the high school to this same dirt road. The turn onto this road is at 35.8328, -117.3375. There is a BLM sign and map at the beginning of this dirt road. Drive up this rough sandy road (designated P 28 on the BLM map) and turn right on road P 27 and go as far as you can. Park and hike up the canyon to the falls (unknown length of hike - not too far we think) where there is a BLM picnic area. The falls has two levels, the lower is easy to reach but has only shallow water. The upper has a very deep pool of very cold water surrounded by huge boulders but climbing up the rocks may be dangerous and should be undertaken only if you feel confident and safe in doing so.

It would be best if you put the below lat/lon in your GPS and see if you can follow that.) Once you get to the campground, park and cross on the footbridge and turn right to go the warm spring.

From the campground, there is also a short (but strenuous hike) on the Elk Creek Trail. In the Sulphur Springs Campground, park and cross on the footbridge and turn left onto the Elk Creek Trail which will take the more adventurous (and physically fit) to a deep swimming hole with jumping rocks around.

WATER   Hot Spring Creek
TYPE    Hot Creek
DESCRIPTION NOTE:  AS OF APRIL 2011, BATHING IS PERMANENTLY NOT ALLOWED AT THIS LOCATION, NO MATTER WHAT YOU MAY READ ELSEWHERE.  DONT GO THERE EXPECTING TO GET IN.

This note came in 2008:"I noticed your report of swimming in Hot Creek near Bishop, Calif. I was there in 2006 and it was closed to swimming due to increased seismic activity and the hot springs increased from scalding to boiling. There is another hot spring in the area but I can not remember it's name but it was located beyond a US Ranger station." 

This from a newspaper report in 12/2008:"...Hot Creek and several hot springs pools near the mountain draw many bathers each year. But federal parks officials have fenced off Hot Creek and banned swimming there because of the risk of extreme temperature changes. More than a dozen people have been killed or scalded in the creek since the 1960s, according to signs posted around the creek. Still, hot springs fans regularly ignore the signs and scale the fences to soak in the super-charged waters. [Some] hot springs enthusiasts suggest bathers use a thermometer, tied to a string, to test water"

The hot springs come up in the midst of a cold creek. Look at the photos. These notes from a visitor:"There have been a few people who really got scalded there because they did not watch where they went in the water. You gradually wade/walk out through the cold water until you start feeling the "hot" water. Then you have to be careful to not go right into it, or you will really get scalded! But all in all, its a great place to visit. If you are ever in this area, GO THERE! There are generally two main hot water vents (places) to soak there in the stream, one downstream and one upstream, and located maybe 200 feet apart from each other. There are also some other thermal features on shore, like fumaroles (steam vents), and in one area a boiling pool of water." See also: HOT SPRINGS ENTHUSIAST.

DEEP CREEK HOT SPRINGS [DEEC]:  (Description, photos and directions by Jim Tighe) "Natural hot springs with man-made rock soaking pools, located along Deep Creek in the San Bernardino National Forest.    WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE  Springs are directly beside Deep Creek, which flows northerly through Deep Creek Canyon from Lake Arrowhead toward the Mojave River.  PHOTO,  PHOTO, PHOTO, PHOTO,PHOTO Soaking pool temperatures range around 104 degrees Fahrenheit, with each pool being slightly different than the others. The springs can be accessed from the Bowen Ranch, the Pacific Crest Trail, or a number of National Forest trailheads in the area.  One small, sandy beach is located directly across Deep Creek from the springs, and another is located immediately upstream of the springs and on the same side of the river.  Several other small beaches are located up and down the creek, among the wooded riparian zone along Deep Creek’s banks.  The spring area is historically VERY clothing- optional.  A varied mixture of clothed and nude visitors will normally be present at any given time.  There is no “nude” or “clothed” area, and visitors mingle together, fully dressed, partially dressed, or totally naked, as they feel comfortable.  If you choose to be nude, there is no need to find an area away from the crowd, and you can freely wander around the hot springs area or up and down Deep Creek wearing nothing at all.  IF YOU ARE OFFENDED BY NUDITY, YOU WILL NOT ENJOY DEEP CREEK HOT SPRINGS!!"

  "To get here From San Bernardino, take I-15 north to Hesperia.  Directions to Bowen Ranch are given, as it is the most popular location.  Beginning from the intersection of Interstate 15 and Main Street, in Hesperia, CA, proceed east on Main Street for approximately 6 miles.  Turn left onto Rock Springs Road.  Rock Springs road will become Roundup Way, and will change from pavement to dirt.  (Do not be confused by Deep Creek Road, which goes to the spillway where Deep Creek enters the Mojave River.  You can access the Pacific Crest Trail at the spillway, if you don’t want to go to Bowen Ranch.)  Continue on Rock Springs Road/Roundup Way for approximately 6 miles.  Turn right onto Bowen Ranch Road.  About 0.5 miles along Bowen Ranch Road, you should find a hard left curve, with a fence made of old tires on the right.  About half-way down Bowen Ranch Road, you should come to a cattle gap with a sign “Entering National Forest”.  Follow Bowen Ranch Road for approximately 5.5 miles total, take the left fork, and continue approximately 0.25 mile further.  Note that your GPS may tell you to turn where no roads exist…these are old roads that cross private property.  Just stick to the main road, don’t take any forks, and your GPS will correct itself shortly.  High-clearance vehicles are recommended due to rough roads and ruts, although small cars can make it with care."  

"Most visitors access the springs from the Bowen Ranch (fee to park and/or camp), which borders the National Forest boundary.  From Bowen Ranch, the hot springs are approximately 2.5 miles away, accessible by hiking, only.  Bowen Ranch is clothing-optional, and nude campers may be present.  The hike from Bowen Ranch to Deep Creek Hot Springs takes approximately 45 minutes going toward the springs, and a bit longer going back toward Bowen Ranch.  This is due to an elevation change of about 1000 feet between the two points.  Hikers should be in good physical condition, and should take plenty of water.  This is a desert environment, and temperatures can reach well over 100 degrees Fahrenheit during the daytime.  Shade along the trails is virtually non-existent, and it is recommended that hiking in should be done early and hiking out should be done just before sundown.  If you depart the hot springs area just as the sun reaches the ridge to the west, there will be shade along most of the trail, while there will still be enough daylight to reach Bowen Ranch.  The Deep Creek Hot Springs area is “day-use only”, and camping within one mile of the river is not allowed.  Keep in mind that after a day of soaking in the hot springs, the uphill hike to Bowen Ranch can be strenuous."

Lat=41.24222, lon=-122.02619(source: DeLorme) (accuracy:general area)
LINK TO GOOGLE MAP

From RT 89 east of McCloud, turn south (right) at the sign for Fowlers Camp (on Fowlers Public Camp Rd.) , then drive 1.2 miles to the Lower Falls parking area. Park and hike the Upper McCloud River Trail upstream, starting at Lower Falls. Middle Falls is at about 1 mile in and is a favorite swimming hole. Upper Falls is about 2.5 miles in. All three falls have swimming places at the bottom and the first two can be pretty crowded on a hot day. All the falls are well marked and having parking lots and paved walkways to the falls "overlook". The middle and upper falls have about a 1 mile hike on well maintained trails. The lower falls has the best area for sun bathing. The middle and upper falls have limited space and rock surfaces. The middle falls is the most user friendly. The road to reach each of the falls is paved. The portion of the road to the middle and upper falls has a number of giant potholes so you might want to drive at a slow to moderate speed.

This is a dog and kid friendly place. Although children should be closely watched since all of the falls have some steep adjoining cliffs near the "Overlook" areas. Each of the falls have picnic areas. The best picnic areas being at the upper and then lower falls. The upper falls swimming hole is really only usable later in the summer when water flow is low.

Note: If driving from the Bay an alternate route is available that you can stop at McArthur-Burney Falls. This route also may be easier than the above route since the Fowler Campground
is located on route 89 about 7-8 miles east of McCloud. 

Take I-5 north toward Redding. From I-5, take exit #680/LAKE BLVD onto CA-299 E toward BURNEY/ALTURAS. The falls are clearly
marked and easy to find in Burney, CA. An entrance fee is required. There is an "overlook" to view the falls. The hike to the base of the falls is about 1.2 miles. From Burney to Fowler Campground in McCloud you need to go as follows:
Starting in BURNEY, CA on MAIN ST go toward SAGINAW ST
Continue on STATE HIGHWAY 299 E(CA-299)
Bear Left on STATE HIGHWAY 89(CA-89)
Continue to follow CA-89 -until you reach Fowler Campground on your left. (from Burney it is about 40 miles).
MCCLOUD RIVER PRESERVE (MCCR):  From the Nature Conservancy Web Site: "The McCloud River is one of California's aquatic jewels. Located near the top of California, north of the Sierra Nevada and at the southern end of the Cascade Range, the McCloud snakes its way down a scenic canyon beneath the rugged slopes of 14,000-foot Mount Shasta. The cool waters of the river roil with life." Fly fishing AND swimming holes.  Get a map at the USFS office in McCloud or at the trailhead if you can - it is said to show swimming holes.  One hole is called the Cattle Camp Swimming Hole.  

To reach the McCloud River Preserve from McCloud:  In the town of McCloud, turn right at the gas station onto Squaw Valley Road and set your trip odometer. Bear right at 9.3 miles, staying on FS road 11. At the 11.9-mile mark, turn right at the sign for "Ah-di-na" campground and the McCloud River Preserve. The road gets progressively rougher from this point: high clearance vehicles are recommended. At the 18-mile mark you'll pass the Forest Service "Ah-di-na" campground. Park near the end of the road at the 19-mile mark.  After parking at the end of a U.S. Forest Service road, cross a foot bridge and follow the sign to the preserve, which you'll reach after walking a gently descending, one-third mile walk along the lower McCloud River. At the preserve entrance you will find a picnic area, staff cabins and an information kiosk with variety of interpretive materials and maps.  It is a three mile hike one way if you go all the way.

To get here from River Road going west, after you pass Steelhead Beach Regional Park and after you cross the bridge over the Russian River, but before you get to Guerneville, see on the south (left) side of the road "Sunset Rd." sign. DO NOT TURN INTO SUNSET RD. - there is no parking on Sunset Rd.. Instead, park in a pay parking lot ($7 day) on the river side of the road. There is no paring on the road. 

Walk down Sunset Rd. then turn right at the sign for the Sonoma County Park and walk downstream. There are several swimming beaches you can walk to along this part of the Russian River. Find your special place and enjoy. Be aware that, if you go au naturel, the county may bother you as may the boy scout troops canoeing by!

RED ROCKS [REDR]: Popular swimming place near Gibraltar Dam in the Los Padres N. F.. Can be pretty crowded on weekends. Litter too. Sandy beach and low rock to jump from. Here is a report from a disappointed visitor in 2005: "The place was wholly disappointing. Low water, lot's of trash and graffiti, and general evidence of abuse and over use. I was surprised since it is very remote and to get there you must travel a long, seemingly endless road. Maybe this place would be better earlier in the year during higher water, but it was rather unappealing. I didn't even go in the water!" Be forewarned! 

From the White Rock Day Use Area (above) continue east on Paradise Rd. until it ends (you will have to ford the river several times). Park and hike on the lower trail near the Santa Ynez River for about .25 miles to the swimming hole. There may be more secluded swimming holes upstream from this one.

BATHING SUITS   Unknown
DIRECTIONS  Directions are from Santa Cruz:

HENRY COWELL REDWOODS S. P. [HENR]: Long-time swimming places in the San Lorenzo River in Henry Cowell State Park north of Santa Cruz. Developed camping also in the State Park. Park web Site . Directions begin at the main entrance to the State Park which is about 6 miles north of Santa Cruz on RT 9, just south of Felton. There is a fee to enter the park - you dont really have to enter the park to go to these places but it might help to go in and get a trail map first.   From the main park entrance, set your odometer and drive south on RT 9 (toward Santa Cruz). 

The first place is called the "Garden of Eden Beach" and is very beautiful. PHOTO , PHOTO . About 1.3 miles south of the park entrance (just south of the Toll House Resort) on RT 9 is a big turnout parking area on the east side (left) of RT 9. Park and walk past the gate on the right which has small park rules signs. This is Ox Trail - take it steeply downhill and bear right to the railroad tracks. For Joyce's beach, follow the dirt path across the railroad tracks (there is no name to the beach so I named it after myself). Some people call this Huck Finn's Hollow. There are some trails down to the river and small beaches near here. PHOTO . 

To get to the Garden of Eden Beach, turn right and walk along the railroad tracks until you see a trail on the left and a sign. Descend down the trail for about 1/4 of a mile or less to the beach or swimming hole.  LAT, LON : lat=37.023392, lon=-122.058262 (source: measured by another) (accuracy:approximate) LINK TO GOOGLE MAP.Note that in and around the Garden of Eden some people have chosen to use this area as clothing optional. However, this is generally not encouraged by the park. 

Another place, at a deep, cool bend in the river, is called Big Rock Hole and is on the Rincon Trail. Drive south on RT 9 until you are about 3 miles south of the park entrance. There is a wide turnout on the east (left) side of RT 9 with a tree in the middle. The Rincon Fire Trail starts at the tree. Park and hike 1/2 mile downhill, wade across the river, then cross a sandy island to get to the Garden of Eden swimming hole. 

There are some other swimming places along the Rincon Trail where it turns left and follows the river. If you stay left all the way the trail goes for 1-2 miles to Frisbee beach. Frisbee Beach Note the other place to swim at is called the "dam". There is a dam that forms a small swimming hole. This is just before Frisbee beach. Very confident. Verified by another. Updated 4/2010. 

JUNCTION PARK [JUNC]: Long-time swimming place with rope swing in the San Lorenzo River in a park in the town of Boulder Creek. PHOTO . From Felton and Henry Cowell Redwoods S. P. drive north on RT 9 to the town of Boulder Creek. Turn east (right) onto Middleton Rd. at the fire station. Junction Park is at the intersection of Middleton and Railroad Avenue. There is also a swimming place at a dam - DAM PHOTO , to get there, continue on Middleton Rd. and turn onto East Lomond Street. Park by the bridge and climb down to a small concrete dam. Junction park has limited parking, bathrooms, picnic tables, and great facilities for BBQ. LAT, LON lat=37.12609, lon=-122.12131(source: DeLorme) (accuracy: approximate) LINK TO GOOGLE MAP.

(If you cannot park in this small area, park in a large area across the road from the campground and walk in). Go past the chain across the trail and walk up this trail. There are spur trails on the left that go down to the creek. The first hole is at the end of the first spur trail. PHOTO . It is large and deep and has a rope swing on a tree on the opposite shore.

DIRECTIONS  SHIRLEY CANYON [SHIR]: The waterfall pools along the Shirley Canyon trail in Squaw Valley offer the perfect chance to cool off. It is a great, beautiful hike up Shirley Canyon any time of year but this is a very seasonal swimming place. The flow may be too strong in spring and too little late in the summer - so be careful. Along the trail, there are several pools large enough to take a dip or to swim, depending on the flow level. 

To get here: From exit 194 on I-80 (near Truckee), go south on RT 89 to the signs on the right for "Squaw Valley". Turn west (right) on Squaw Valley Rd., follow the main road to the west through the entire Squaw Valley development area until you come to the westernmost end of the road where there are condominium buildings. The trailhead is rather apparent in between the condo buildings. Park here, but be careful NOT to park in the private condo parking areas - there is public parking along the road right at the trailhead for the Shirley Canyon trail. Hike up this beautiful trail along Squaw Creek and you will find pools of various sizes. PHOTO 1 , PHOTO 2 .

It's a small alpine pond filled with crystal clear, snowmelt offering an arctic dip in the hottest heat of summer. Edged with snow even in July, the beauty of Shirley Lake is beyond description."

You will enter the Granite Chief Wilderness then shortly come to the first lake on your left.  If you continue on the trail, the two largest lakes will be on your left also.  There are some nice swimming spots with large rocks to enter from on these two lakes and the small stream connecting them.

TRUCKEE RIVER [TRUC]: Continue south on RT 89 (from above) and the road continues to parallel the Truckee River. There are ample opportunities to swim in the river, however, there is a very deep, very large swimming hole here: after you pass Alpine Meadows road on your right go approximately 2 miles more and look for a small dirt pull off on the right side of the road near the rather obvious swimming hole. RT 89 is rather featureless and it is difficult to give meaningful points of reference. However, if you keep an eye to the river as you are traveling south on RT 89, you will easily spot this large swimming area.in the Truckee River offers one of the best places to swim. PHOTO 1 , PHOTO 2 . 

There is a commercial tubing rafting operation near Lake Tahoe that rents tubes and rafts to travel up the Truckee River. The flow along the river is controlled by a dam release, so water levels can vary dramatically but even when the water is very low and many people have to walk their tubes and rafts through the water this swimming hole remains nice and cool and deep. There are several campgrounds on RT 28 and RT 89 circling Lake Tahoe. LAT, LON lat=39.16503, lon=-120.17415(source: measured) (accuracy:exact) LINK TO GOOGLE MAP. Verified. Very confident.

THE POTHOLES ON SILVER FORK [POTH]: The Silver Fork of the American River begins at Silver Lake and forms some potholes on a granite rock surface which are great for swimming. See the web site ABOUT LAKE TAHOE for photos and details. To get here from Tahoe, continue south on RT 89 to Picketts Junction then turn east (right) on RT 88 and continue past Kirkwood toward Silver Lake. Just past the Silver Lake West Campground (on the north side) is a road on the south side to Kit Carson lodge. Park here on the south side, cross the road and walk through the campground (or, if you are camping here, no need to park!) Follow the trail that goes along the river and walk (easy hike) about 20 minutes to the potholes. LAT, LON : lat=38.67906, lon=-120.13127(source: DeLorme) (accuracy:approximate) LINK TO GOOGLE MAP.

GROVER HOT SPRINGS S. P.[GROV]: Grover has hot and cold both. Naturally hot water is led into a concrete swimming pool (next to a cool swimming pool) and, with a short hike of about 1.5 miles each way, a waterfall with a cool place to swim in the pool below. Camping and all facilities are at the State Park. LAT, LON : lat=38.7008, lon=-119.8392(source: DeLorme) (accuracy:approximate) LINK TO GOOGLE MAP. To get here from Tahoe or Picketts Junction, continue south on RT 89 to Markleeville. Follow signs to Grover Hot Springs S. P..

The hot and cool pools are well signed once you are in the State Park - there is a $5.00 per person/per use fee (in 2004) to use the hot/cold pools. 

To get to the swimming hole at the falls, hike about 1.5 miles each way and cool off in a swimming hole in the Hot Springs Creek. Here is a quote from web site: "The trail starts at the end of the campground on a dirt road ($3.00 per vehicle parking fee.) This is the Burnside Lake Trail. There are a couple junctions to look for. Shortly after starting the hike, you will come to a junction with a single track trail to the left. Follow this trail. Then at about 1 mile, you reach another trail junction. Go left to follow Hot Springs Creek (the Burnside Lake Trail continues right). When you come to a boulder-filled area, you need to climb straight up and over the boulders (do not go down to the creek here). After you climb over the boulders, pick up the trail again. The waterfall is only a few minutes away." LAT, LON :lat=38.69819, lon=-119.86321(source: above web site) (accuracy:exact) LINK TO GOOGLE MAP. Very confident, Verified 9/04. Updated 9/24/2004.

FISH HATCHERY [FISH]: Not the greatest swimming hole but a really nice walk along the Mad River under the cottonwoods to a traditionally-clothing-optional remote swimming area in the river. Water may be shallow in the heat of summer. PHOTO 1 , PHOTO 2 . This is a long way west on RT 299 from Willow Creek (or east of Arcata) in the town of Blue Lake. Take the Blue Lake exit from RT 299 and drive a short way to Chartin Rd. where you go right then in a short distance go left on South Railroad St.. Go to the end of South Railroad St. then go right on Hatchery Rd. and go a couple of miles to the Mad River Fish Hatchery at the end of Hatchery Rd.. 

Keep to the right and drive to the far end of the parking area at the fish hatchery where there is a picnic table and rest room. Park here and walk through the fence opening past the sign that says "Fishing Access for Handicapped". Walk to the right alongside and parallel to the tanks on an asphalt path. When the asphalt ends, continue straight on a dirt path. In a short way this path will end where there is a short rocky descent to the river. Go down the rocks (easy path) and ford the river if currents permit - it may be waist deep or deeper at the far side here so be ready for this and don't try to cross if it is too deep or too swift. There is no bridge. 

On the far side, walk in the upstream direction (there is an old road you can walk on) for about .5 miles until you come past the first river bend and find clothing-optional swimming places and small beachy areas.

DIRECTIONS  Along RT 140 from Mariposa/southwest entrance and Yosemite valley area:

BRYCEBURG RECREATION AREA [BRYC]: Camping, rafting and swimming in a BLM Recreation Area along the Merced River. BLM INFO . From Mariposa, take RT 140 12 miles to Bryceburg. At Bryceburg, cross the bridge over the Merced River and drive downstream on an old railroad grade that is now a road (appears to be a dead end).

Pretty confident. Not verified. Updated 12/2008.

HITES COVE [HITE]: A place to swim in the South Fork Merced River, a hike off of RT 140. Take Rt 140 (past Bryceburg, above) to where the Merced River and South Fork Merced Rivers come together at a large bridge. Park at a turnout on the north side of the bridge and cross the road and go toward the river (there are some chalets here). Find the trail along the South Fork and follow it toward the Hites Cove area. There will be some side trails off to the river and swimming holes. No better directions.

MERCED RIVER [MERC]: A favorite spot to swim in Yosemite Valley off RT 140. Continue east on RT 140 and swim in the Merced River at the sandy bars between Clark's Bridge and Sentinel Beach near Housekeeping Camp beach. LAT, LON lat=37.74178, lon=-119.58331(source: DeLorme) (accuracy: approximate) LINK TO GOOGLE MAP. Pretty confident. Not verified. Updated 5/2007.

Along RT 41 from Oakhurst/south entrance to Yosemite (no fee at this entrance):

FISH CAMP FALLS [FISF]: Three falls and two swimming holes. The middle hole is popular due to the sculptured granite. The top falls is the most photogenic. There is no real swimming hole at the first falls.  All the falls are about 25 feet in height. To get here from Oakhurst, drive north on RT 41 for 15 miles to the turn off on Big Sandy Road (aka Jackson Rd.) about 0.5 miles south of Fish Camp. Set odometer.  Turn east (right) and drive 2.5 miles to a dirt pullout on the right. On the left is a metal gate. Go past the gate and follow the trail past an old abandoned cabin. The trail tracks along the flume for about 0.5 miles until you reach the first falls. The other two falls are about 300 yards beyond the first falls. The trail ends at the top of the last falls.

SKINNY DIP [SKIN]: Two falls with steep slab rocks and small, deep pools at the bottom. YOUTUBE , YOUTUBE .  To get here from Fish Camp Falls, continue east on Big Sandy Road (aka Jackson Rd.) another 1.0 miles up the hill for a total of 3.5 miles from RT 41. Skinny Dip is a little difficult to locate, but the GPS coordinates(below) should be correct. On Big Sandy Rd. there is a small pull off on the right just before the road banks to the left. The trail down to the river is covered over by some tree branches. It is right over a small drain pipe. You can't see the drain pipe easily either unless you traverse over the side of the road slightly. LAT, LON lat=37.46694444, lon=-119.6041667 (source: measured-p)(accuracy: exact) LINK TO GOOGLE MAP. 

Just downstream from Skinny Dip (about 200 yards) are the slabs and several swimmable pools called ARROWHEAD (may be fewer people too than Skinny Dip). LAT, LON lat=37.4672, lon=-119.6075 (source: measured-p)(accuracy: exact) LINK TO GOOGLE MAP.  It is basically a few slabs downstream and easy to get to from Skinny Dip. To get to Arrowhead just go to Skinny Dip and walk down stream. That is the easiest way. Very confident. Verified by Tim Joyce. Updated 8/10.

WAWONA [WAWO]: Another favorite spot to swim in Yosemite but not in the Valley - it is in the South Fork Merced River near the Wawona Hotel on RT 41 near the south border of the park. Maybe not as crowded as places in the Valley. To get here, continue north on RT 41 from Fish Camp and go to Wawona. To get here from the Wawona Hotel, walk the path from the hotel to the old barn (for square dances) and follow the road beside the barn to the end of the road and walk down the path there to the swinging bridge to the river on the left. LAT, LON lat=37.53869, lon=-119.65583(source: DeLorme) (accuracy: approximate) LINK TO GOOGLE MAP. Pretty confident. Not verified. Updated 5/2007. 

CHILNUALNA CREEK [CHIL]: Near the one above, but an uphill hike of about 1 mile to get there. Enter the park near the south side on RT 41 and go to Wawona (see above also). Go past the Wawona with the Golf Course on the left. Chilnualna Rd. will be about 0.5 miles on the right. It is a sharp right turn and easy to miss. The road continues for about 2 miles and weaves its way through a series of homes, schools and town homes. You will come to an incline and the dirt parking lot will be on the right. There is a bathroom here. The trail head and trail are actually up on the left about another 1/4 of a mile. If you reach a bridge going over Chilnualna Creek you have gone too far. 

The trail climbs along the creek which will be to your right. The lower Chilnualna Creek Falls are about 0.5 miles up the trail. You can't miss them. Hike about 1 mile up this trail and, where the trail goes off to the left, keep to the right and go another .25 miles upstream. Here there is a beautifully contoured rock basin and a great swimming hole. Photo of lower Chilnualna Falls . Locals refer to this swimming hole as "The Ledge", for obvious reasons. This is not an easy swimming hole to reach and requires a third class scramble to reach it. It is not recommended early in the year because the water flow is fairly high and in at least one point you must cross the falls and river (ropes are recommended for early spring). Further, the easiest approach is via the rocks adjacent to the falls. This area can get quite slippery in spring and early summer. Later in the summer it should be dry.

"Honeymooners" is a clothing optional tub which is positioned just above "The Ledge". It can only be accessed by ascending a very steep small path on the east side of the creek (right side looking at the rocks). It ascends between the rocks. A trail then runs along the top of the cliff and descends down to a dangerous ledge which you must "tip toe" across to reach the tubs. These tubs are clothing optional and can not be easily viewed from below. However, from the tubs the entire creek is visible. One local said she saw a bear on the adjoining cliff one year, so take precautions.

For some pictures of "The Ledge" and "Honeymooners" see swimmingholesofcalifornia.blogspot . Note that both Honeymooners and The Ledge are not family friendly swimming holes because they require some extensive climbing on third class scrambles.

If you go back and continue up the main trail another 3 miles you will get to Chilnualna Falls which is another water-play place. LAT, LON lat=37.55544, lon=-119.62722(source: DeLorme) (accuracy: approximate) LINK TO GOOGLE MAP. Pretty confident. Not verified. Updated 5/2007. 

Along RT 120 from Groveland/northwest entrance to Yosemite:

RAINBOW POOLS [RAIP]: The Rainbow Pools are popular swimming hole on the south fork of the Tuolumne river. You can swim, jump from low ledges or watch courageous kids jump from the very high ones. PHOTO, PHOTO , YOUTUBE .  To get here from Groveland (western side of Yosemite) go about 13 miles east on RT 120 (toward Yosemite National Park). The Rainbow Pool turnoff is on the right just before the highway bridge over the South Fork of the Tuolumne River. This is just before the road to Cherry Lake/Sweetwater Camp on the left. There is a marker sign and the road proceeds down to the falls. The road is one way and there are parking and bathrooms near the falls.

To get here, continue on RT 120 and look for the turnoff to Camp Mather and Hetchy Hetchy and turn onto Evergreen Road. About a mile on Evergreen Road look for a pullout on the north side of the bridge near the "Carlon Day Use Area" sign. This pullout is where the Carlon Falls Trail begins.

CASCADE CREEK [CASC]: (Description, photos and directions by Timothy H. Joyce, used by permission) Beautifully wooded, boulder-lined, aquamarine creek in Yosemite N. P. near Crane Flat and Tamarack Flat.  PHOTO , PHOTO , PHOTO , PHOTO . The hike to Cascade Creek is about 2 to 2.4 miles one way or 4-5 miles roundtrip. Save enough energy for the hike back since it is all uphill. You are also at fairly high elevation, so bring lots of extra water!  This is a moderate level hike.

Drive southeast down the old Big Oak Flat Road to the east end of Tamarack Flat Campground, 3.25 miles. The road is paved and slightly bumpy, but in good shape.

The hiking trail is the actual road you are driving on. Access will be blocked at a turn around point at the end of the campground. There are bathrooms at the campground. Just before you reach a prominent cluster of rocks--ideal for rock-climbing practice--your road begins a steady descent to Cascade Creek. At a road switchback just 240 yards before the bridge across this creek, you'll see a junction with a trail to the new Big Oak Flat Road.  Along the first 200 yards below its bridge, Cascade Creek splashes down low cascades into small pools,
and in late season these make nice "swimming holes." Before then the creek is likely to be too swift for safe frolicking, particularly since the water-polished rock can be quite slippery. Explore up and down stream (no real trail) to find the places in the photos.

 
POHONO BRIDGE [POHO]: Nice little swimming hole in the Merced River in the heart of the Yosemite Valley under a bridge. To get here continue east on RT 120 then turn south (right) on Big Oak Rd. and/or just head for Yosemite Village on RT 140. Take RT 140 east toward Yosemite Village . Where RT 140 forks, to become Northside Dr and Southside Dr., turn right and, here the Pohono Bridge crosses the river. The swimming place is here. Link to pictures , YOUTUBE .

TUOLUMNE/WATERWHEEL [TUOW]: Here's a several-day backpacking hike featuring spectacular waterfalls and swimming holes along the Tuolumne River - at least 20 miles roundtrip to the swimming areas, 40 miles roundtrip if you do the entire trail. The trailhead is north of the valley, on RT 120 (Tioga Road) near Lembert Dome, which is well signed. Park at the trailhead and take the Waterwheel Falls/Pate Valley trail to the west along the Tuolumne River. You will pass California Falls and shortly after Waterwheel Falls Return Creek will come in from the north. From here to Pate Valley there are said to be numerous swimming holes along this trail. No better directions. LAT, LON lat=37.93172, lon=-119.46569(source: DeLorme) (accuracy: general area) LINK TO GOOGLE MAP. Pretty confident. Not verified. Updated 5/2007. 

From Coulterville, which is south of Groveland at RT 49 and RT 132, also on the west side of Yosemite:

DIANA FALLS [DIAN]:Huge, deep hole in a rocky basin at the foot of Diana Falls. To get here from Coulterville, follow Main St. out of town to the east. Main St. becomes Greeley Hill Road. Follow Greeley Hill Road up the hill and all the way until the Bridge over the North Fork of the Merced River. Greeley Hill Road forks at the top of the hill. Make sure to stay right at the fork. That is it! There is trash and graffiti at this site and there is often a forest service ranger parked on the road to watch the parking lot for abuse. 

Note that the trail is well marked and there is a gate near the parking area. The parking area will be on the left side of the road just before the bridge. Note that if you cross the bridge and go too far, the road changes to dirt. The hike in is about 1 mile to the confluence of Bean Creek. The falls are about 200 yards further up the trail on Bean Creek and will be on your left. Also, there are a few tubs down stream from the falls. They tend to be clothing optional and hidden.

DIRECTIONS  From Sacramento, take I-80 northeast to Exit 119 at Auburn. Take Rt 49 north toward Grass Valley. (Note that Rt 49 and Rt 20 overlap at one point.) Follow Rt 49/20 into Nevada City. Then: 

EDWARDS CROSSING [EDWC]: Apparently a very popular (i.e., crowded) spot on the South Yuba but quieter places are nearby. PHOTO , PHOTO.  To get here from Nevada City, at the split of Rt 20 and Rt 49 in Nevada City turn left (sharp left) (Nevada City Carriage Company is on the right). Drive for about 1/4 of a mile or less. North Bloomfield road is the second road on the right after Coyote Rd.( there is a fire station at the corner). Take North Bloomfield road for about 1 mile until the "T" in the road and bear right. 

Follow North Bloomfield road for about 8 miles until the South Yuba Recreation area and Edwards Crossing. The last mile of road to Edwards Crossing is very narrow and steep, so take it slow. The road is paved all the way until Edwards Crossing. It is much better to approach Edwards Crossing from the south side of the bridge. The road on the north side is not paved. Also, the parking is on the south side of the bridge and that is where the bathrooms are located.

This is a very popular place so get there early since the parking can fill up quickly. ("I got there at 9 AM and was the only one there in April. However, at 11 AM there were about 40 cars!!!") This place is right here under the bridge. LAT, LON : lat=39.330197, lon=-120.984125 (source: DeLorme) (accuracy:exact) LINK TO GOOGLE MAP. Very confident. Verified by another. Updated 6/2010. 


MOUNTAIN DOG  [MOUN]:    Where Spring Creek comes into the South Yuba, there is a small falls and nice swimming hole - bathing suits optional. Park at Edwards Crossing (above), but avoid the crowds by hiking downstream on a trail along the north side of the river about a mile to the side creek and falls. PHOTO, PHOTO , PHOTO , YOUTUBE , YOUTUBE .  .    For a beautiful view of the swimming area and a video taken in April, 2010, please see swimmingholesofcalifornia.blogspot.com/.The trail to "Spring Creek" is located on the north side of the bridge. It is easy to find and locate. The hike is about 1 mile to the creek and swimming holes. Here, and a bit further downstream, are the swimming places.

Updated 4/2010. There are at least two ways to get here:

FIRST WAY:   The first way is the easier, quite level and about 5-6 miles round trip. To get here, from Edwards Crossing (above) continue on North Bloomfield Rd about 1 mile to signs for the South Yuba Campground. From the campground, hike the South Yuba Trail south to the river then east along the river to North Canyon. The swimming holes are in North Canyon.  

Here is a report from Tim Joyce using this trail in 5/2010:  "Yesterday we hiked North Canyon via the South Yuba trail (South Yuba Campground). It was much easier than the Humbug trail hike. Although this is still a very hot Canyon and people need to be advised to bring enough water (at least 2 bottles each).  From the trail head it is about 2 miles to Overlook point and then another 1 mile to the North Canyon Spur Trail (this is the trail that heads down to the river with the switchbacks). There is a marker at the spur trail. The spur trail does not look like a trail since it is slightly overgrown. It is easy to miss and people need to note that is right across from the marker sing in North Canyon. As you proceed down the trail it gets better. The trail down to the canyon has a number of "switch backs". It is about 0.4 miles. So the hike distance is about 6-7 miles round trip for this hike.

"You can pick up the South Yuba Trail at the end of the upper parking area at the South Yuba campground. I recommend taking the North Bloomfield road to Edwards Crossing. Crossing the bridge and driving up the dirt road about 3 miles until you reach the South Yuba Campground exit. It will be on the right and descends down a hill. The road is dirt, but in good condition and easily drivable by any car. You proceed down the hill and come to a fork. You proceed to the right. The lower road goes to the campground. The upper to the parking. The parking area is obvious. You can park in this top lot. Note that there are bathrooms here. 

"The trail to the South Yuba trail is actually not labeled and is at the back of this parking lot. You just follow this unmarked trail down and it will go for about 0.5 miles until you reach a sign indicating the South Yuba Trail. You will know you are on the right trail since it parallels the road to the campground which you will see from the trail. There are no markers along the way, but this is the only trail down. After hiking a while you will reach the trail head. There is a big sign and it is obvious. Note at this sign the South Yuba is to the left and goes up the slight incline. 

"At Overlook point there are picnic tables, but no real view. The best view of the Canyon is about 0.2 miles from the North canyon Spur trail (see attached photo). You can see the entire canyon.
We encountered a number of mountain bikers on this trail. The trail is fairly level with some slight inclines. I would rate it of moderate difficulty. However, it is a long way to the Canyon floor. I would recommend this for the hike first and the swimming hole second. If you are going to use the swimming hole you need to leave early. Otherwise, you will find yourself reaching the hole and then having to hike back almost immediately to avoid hiking in the dark.  The river flow is strong in May and nearly non-existent in September, so people need to plan accordingly.

SECOND WAY:  The second way is more strenuous and begins in Malakoff Diggins S.P.. To get here, from Edwards Crossing (above) continue on North Bloomfield Rd to Malikoff Diggins S.P. (has camping). This from a visitor:” In the State Park, take the Humbug Trail (2.4 miles one way) then the South Yuba Trail (1.5 miles one way) down to the river and the swimming holes. The hike down the Humbug trail is about 2.4 miles (there is a picnic table at the end of the trail to rest). The Humbug trail is fairly steep so people should leave early since the hike is long and you don't want to be hiking up this trail in the dark due to the ledges. You must then pick up the South Yuba trail and hike around another 1.5 miles to reach a series of switch backs. This is a long hike. Then, after you hike the South Yuba trail you must take a series of switchbacks down to the river. This will deliver you to the hole. Note that this is really a 9-10 mile hike to the swimming hole and back. People really need to bring plenty of water on this hike. Visiting too early in the year the waters can be strong. In September, most of the water will have left the canyon so it is not as wonderful." 

SHANGRI-LA [SHAN]: A very popular (i.e. - crowded) swimming place under the RT 49 bridge over the South Yuba River but a much quieter place a short way upstream. The place at the bridge is has boulders and swimming tunnels and slides that are absolutely exceptional and worth putting up with the crowd. YOUTUBE . To get here from Nevada City, take RT 49 northwest to where it crosses over the South Yuba River. The main swimming hole is right here at the bridge with the other upstream. Hike about 1/3 mile upstream to a much quieter place which is the best spot for swimming and high jumping into emerald green water with only a few others around.

SOUTH YUBA RIVER S. P. [SOUP]: A linear, discontinuous state park along the South Yuba River with several swimming places along the way. To get here from SHANGRI-LA (above), continue on RT 49 northwest about 5 miles then turn west (left) on Pleasant Valley Rd. and go 7.5 miles to the South Yuba River S. P. Bridgeport Visitors Center near Bridgeport. Stop by the visitor center for a trail guide or to get other basic information about the park. 

There is a wooden truss bridge here and several trails up and down the river begin near this bridge.  Try the Point Defiance Trail and Loop: From parking area cross covered bridge and turn immediately left (west) downriver. Follows river downstream to where the river flows into Englebright Lake.  Also  the Cemetery/ Virginia Turnpike Loop Trail: A half hour gentle stroll with a great swim hole at the end. Follow signs from Visitor Center parking area.  The short "River Overlook/Bridgeport trail goes below the visitors center and downstream a short distance to a family beach for swimming. Another trail, the Kneebone Beach Trail, goes upstream on the south side of the river .4 miles to a scenic swimming hole outlined by granite rocks.

MIDDLE YUBA BRIDGE [MIDB]: There is a swimming hole under the Middle Yuba Bridge that is very popular. Many people go there since there are bathrooms and parking. PHOTO  ,  PHOTO  To get here, continue north on RT 49 until you cross the bridge over the Middle Yuba River.

MUSHROOM HOLE [MUSH]: In the Tahoe National Forest in the Middle Yuba River is a popular, deep hole with a large, mushroom-shaped rock to jump from. [NOTE: It is no longer possible to go the way described below to reach Mushroom Hole or Strawberry - the landowner has constructed an electric fence. We are seeking another way to get here. Skip it for now.] To get here, on RT 49 cross the bridge over the Middle Yuba River then make an immediate left turn onto Moonshine Creek Rd. Go 1 mile then park and do not block any driveways as there is private property hereabouts. Look for a trail on the left that goes steeply down (wear sturdy shoes) to the river then hike downstream for about 1/2 mile. The first swimming hole is known as Strawberry and is often crowded but if you continue about 250 yards further downstream you will come to Mushroom Hole. Watch out for poison oak.

OREGON CREEK [OREG]: Beautiful hole with large flat rocks all around. Clothing optional.  PHOTO , PHOTO, PHOTO, YOUTUBE , YOUTUBE . This is not a deep hole - maybe about 6-8 feet max.  DO NOT DIVE HERE- there have been a number of injuries. There is also a few little tubs that have circulating water that acts like a hot tub. One falls steps down and the other braids together. You can actually go under the falls. There is an air space and plenty of room for about 3 people. Also at the top of the step down falls is a pot hole you can submerge into and go through a secret passage to the middle rock where you can come up. It is very neat.

To get here, set your odometer at the Middle Yuba Bridge and go a little under 1.0 mile north on RT 49 from the bridge over the Middle Yuba and park at a small turn off on the right side of the road (look closely, this turn off is not easy to find. Note that right before the turn off there is a rusted guard rail with a white road marker that says YUB 49. That is the first marker you will see while driving. Next to this marker and closer to the parking place is a second white marker that has the number 101 on it. If you still can't find it and are in doubt, the road is marked here with the number 213') . There is a big dirt hump at the parking area you go over to get to the trail. Walk a short way (.25 miles) or less down a well-maintained trail to Oregon Creek and the swimming hole.

DOWNIEVILLE AREA[DOWN]: Downieville, on the North Yuba River, is a center for mountain biking with lots of trails along the river. Many swimming holes are accessible on these trails. YOUTUBE . Details are not presented here, ask at local bike outfitters about rides and swimming holes. Downieville is on RT 49 about 44 miles from Nevada City. As you approach Downieville on RT 49 you will be paralleling the river where you may see additional swimming holes.

INDIAN SPRINGS [INDI]: Another location in the South Yuba River with clear water and waterfalls to sit under and plenty of flat warm granite rocks to lie on and sunbathe. To get here from Colfax on I-80, continue on I-80 east towards Reno. Exit at Eagle Lakes road near Donner Summit (Exit 164). Go north under the freeway and follow the road around to the west and you will come to Indian Springs campground. The swimming hole is here in the river.

LAKES BASIN CAMPGROUND [LAKE]: Not really in the Yuba River Area, but not too far away either. Near BLAIRSDEN, SIERRAVILLE and GRAEAGLE. At the Lakes Basin Campground in the Plumas N.F. there is a swimming hole in an unnamed creek. To get here from I-80 (above), continue on I-80 east to exit 196 (Truckee area) and take RT 89 north through Sierraville (Stay on RT 89) through Clio to Graeagle (before Blairsden). In Graeagle look for the intersection of RT 89 and Forest Rd. 24 (Gold Lake road or Gold Lake Forest Rd.) and turn west (left) on RT 24 and go about 7 miles to the campground sign. The swimming hole is in a creek in or near the campground. LAT, LON : lat=39.70064, lon=-120.65908(source: DeLorme) (accuracy: approximate) LINK TO GOOGLE MAP. Pretty confident. Not verified.

JOHNSVILLE [JOHN]: Not really in the Yuba River Area, but not too far away either. Near BLAIRSDEN, SIERRAVILLE and GRAEAGLE. YOUTUBE , YOUTUBE . Beautiful pool, jumping and VERY cold water. Very near the Plumas-Eureka State Park, where there is camping and all facilities. To get here from Graegle (above) go north on RT A14 and continue onto Johnsville Rd.. Keep on Johnsville Rd for about 5 miles where the road make a very sharp right hand curve. Continue around the curve and, in a short distance, park in the Johnsville Cemetery parking lot. Walk down the path, steep at first, for about .5 mile total to Jamison Creek. The falls and swimming hole are here.
